## DESCRIPTION:
##  This script is an utility that simplifies the UE-diff-tool usage via git.
##
## HOW IT WORKS:
##  Git provides the possibility to use thirdparty tools to DIFF and MERGE the files.
##  Unreal provides both tools for the binary `.uasset`.
##  By following the SETUP section, you will be able to use the `git difftool -t UE_Diff`
##  to compare two versions using the unreal-difftool.
##
## REQUIREMENTS:
##  - Python
##  - Git
##
## SETUP:
##  1. Copy this script into the project folder.
##  2. It's necessary to setup the GIT difftool & mergetool by opening the `.gitconfig` file
##     (In Windows it's generally located inside `C:\Users\{The User Name}\.gitconfig`);
##  3. Add the following config:
##     ```
##     [difftool "UE_Diff"]
##          cmd = C:/Users/{The User Name}/git-ue-diff.bat "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL"
##          binary = true
##     
##     [mergetool "UE_Merge"]
##          cmd = C:/Users/{The User Name}/git-ue-diff.bat "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$BASE" "$MERGED"
##          binary = true
##     ```
##  4. Alongside the `.gitconfig` file, create a file named `git-ue-diff.bat`, then add the following code:
##     ```
##     py %cd%\difftool.py %*
##     ```
##
## USAGE:
##  This script is executed by GIT when running `git difftool -t UE_Diff` or `git mergetool -t UE_Merge`
##
## NOTES:
##  You don't need to specify the project dir or the unreal engine installation dir, because this script will fetch these.
##  Note, if unreal is not installed inside a common directory, you can provide the editor path by defining the environment variable  `UE5.1_EDITOR_PATH` (Change the unreal version accordingly).
##  This script works only on Windows, at the moment.
